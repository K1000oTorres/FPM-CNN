They present a method that models the Fourier Ptychograph forward process using a CNN and recovers the complex object information in the network training process. In the proposed approach, the networkâ€™s input is the Point Spread Function (PSF) in the spatial domain. The object is treated as 2D learnable weights of a convolution layer. The output of the network is modeled as the loss function that is intended to be minimized.
